#CoreJavaNotes
This project is some sandbox coding to brush up on some Java skills and to try out some features
of Java 8. It was created in Android Studio which requires some adjustments to create pure Java projects

- Remove `include ':app'` from the root project's `settings.gradle`
- Remove `app` directory
- Create folder hierarchy for your Java code (src/main/java) and test code (src/test/java)
- Replace root project's `build.gradle` with:

```
apply plugin: 'java'

sourceCompatibility = 1.8
version = '1.0'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11'
}
```

- Make sure to right-click the `test` folder and Mark Directory As > Test Sources Root.
